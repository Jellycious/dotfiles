# dotfiles

## description
This repository holds configuration files and dotfiles for programs which I commonly use.
Some of these files have dependencies on them so they might not work 'out of the box'. 

## automatic sync
Automatically adds all changes to a commit and pushes it to the git directory.

## replace my dotfiles
This will setup the new dotfiles. It will not install the required dependencies.

IMPORTANT: This will delete the dotfiles in your current HOME directory.
